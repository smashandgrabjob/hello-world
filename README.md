# hello-world
Hi peepz!

Bryn here. I'm currently focused on AWS development (starting with CSA, but next up being the other associate certs), but have robust experience in Atlassian administration (Crowd/JIRA/Confluence), along with other foundational CMS (SharePoint, Drupal, etc.). 
I've never had tacos on the moon but that sounds pretty bangin and I'd be all about some interstellar southwest cuisine.
